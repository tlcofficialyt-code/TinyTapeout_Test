## How it works

AND Gates Inputs connected to Pins AND a and AND b, output is connected to AND
NAND Gates Inputs connected to Pins AND a and AND b, output is connected to NAND


OR Gates Inputs connected to Pins OR a and OR b, output is connected to OR
NOR Gates Inputs connected to Pins OR a and OR b, output is connected to NOR

XOR Gates Inputs connected to Pins XOR a and XOR b, output is connected to XOR
XNOR Gates Inputs connected to Pins XOR a and XOR b, output is connected to XNOR

NOT Gates Input connected to Not Pin, output is connected to NOT
